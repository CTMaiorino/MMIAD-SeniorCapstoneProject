# Quinnipiac Software Engineering Capstone Project 2020-2021

The MMIAD System is a research development tool created mostly for bioinformatics.
Deployed fully on Google Cloud Platform using CloudSQL, web infrastructures such as Node.js, Sequealize ORM, Express, Bootsrap, etc.
The system consists of a fully functional front-end UI, integrated with a back-end server which communicates with the Google CloudSQL Database through the Sequealize ORM and HTTP requests. The main function of the system is to allow researchers to lookup and categorize major and minor intron information to further genetic research.
